    <p>
        Hello,
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for participating in this experiment!
        Please read the following instructions carefully as they will explain everything you need to do
        during the experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a participant of this experiment, you have been given an initial income of {{player.payoff}}, which
        can be seen at the top right corner. This amount will be part of your total earnings throughout the
        experiment and might change during the course of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this experiment, your additional earnings only depend on your own decisions.
        You will be asked to make a decision between two different options in several rounds. In each
        round you will have to choose between “Lottery A” or “Lottery B”. For each lottery, you can
        earn two different sums of money, depending on the associated probabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider for example the following lotteries:
    </p>

    <h4>Lottery A</h4> 

    <b>1/10 of $2.00, 9/10 of $1.60</b> 

    <h4>Lottery B</h4>

    <b>1/10 of $3.85, 9/10 of $0.10</b>

    <p>
        Choosing Lottery A pays €2 with probability 1/10 (1 out of 10 times, or 10%) and €1.60
        with probability 9/10 (9 out of 10 times or 90%). Choosing Lottery B pays €3.85
        with probability 1/10 (1 out of 10 times, or 10%) and €0.10 with probability 9/10 (9 out of
        10 times or 90%).
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have made the choice of Lottery A or Lottery B, you will immediately be asked to
        make a similar choice with different lotteries. At the end of all the rounds, one of these rounds
        will be randomly chosen and the result of your chosen lottery in this round will be added to your
        total earnings. As you don&#39;t know in advance which decision row will be ultimately used, please
        think about each one carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to these choices, you will be asked to fill questionnaires about your current emotional
        status throughout the experiment and a small survey at the end of it. All your answers are
        completely anonymous and will only be used for the purposes of this study.
    </p>

    <p>
        After completing this experiment, there is a 10% chance that you will earn your total
        earnings (€). If you are selected, you will be contacted via e-mail to receive your
        payment through Paypal (your e-mail information will only be used for this purpose).
